# Project Guideline

This project follows the [Git Momentum](https://www.gitmomentum.com) workflow. For workflow rules, see the [specification](https://www.gitmomentum.com/spec.html). This document defines the project-specific policies.

---

## Names

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Trunk branch | `main` |
| Deployment branches | none — Loupe is released as a container image; the deployment pins an image version in its infrastructure code |
| Update branch pattern | `update/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-description>` or `update/<YYYYMMDD>-<ticket-id>-<short-description>` |
| Hotfix branch pattern | not used — without deployment branches, fixes go through update branches and ship as a patch release |

The ticket-id segment is optional; the date is always required.

## Conventions

### Commit messages

When committing with an AI agent, use the [commit skill](.agents/skills/commit/SKILL.md), which encodes the rules below.

Squash-merge and direct-push commits to `main` MUST follow:

```
[<type>] <subject>

<optional body>
```

**Types:**

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feature` | New feature or user-visible enhancement (an input type, a tool capability, a configuration option). |
| `fix` | Bug fix. |
| `refactor` | Internal restructuring with no behavior change. |
| `build` | Build system, dependencies, tooling, Docker image. |
| `ci` | CI configuration. |
| `docs` | Documentation. |
| `chore` | Anything else. |

**Subject rules:**
- Imperative mood ("Add", not "Added").
- ≤ 72 characters on the first line.
- Describes what changed, not which file.

**Body:** optional, blank line above. Explains *why* and any non-obvious context.

**Example:**

```
[feature] Read multi-page TIFF scans page by page in accurate mode

Each TIFF page becomes its own vision call, so a fax with twenty
pages is transcribed in full instead of only its first page.
```

### Version tags

When tagging with an AI agent, use the [version skill](.agents/skills/version/SKILL.md), which encodes the rules below and the major / minor / patch decision logic.

Pattern: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (matched by `v[0-9]*`).

Tags are created manually by the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) on release-worthy commits. Tags are the only source of truth for versions; there is no version file to bump. The version of any commit is derived with:

```
git describe --tags --candidates=100 --match='v[0-9]*' --abbrev=4
```

Pushing a tag triggers the release pipeline, which builds the image `ghcr.io/coreprocess/loupe-mcp:<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (and `:<major>.<minor>`) and embeds the version as `LOUPE_VERSION`. The deployment pins the image by version or digest.

The configuration (environment variables), the tool interface, the upload and download endpoints and the result formats (manifest, page markup) are the public contract. Breaking any of them is a major change.

## Permissions and shortcuts

| Item | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Direct push to `main` | Allowed for the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md). The pushed commit MUST follow the commit message convention. |
| Tags | Created and pushed by the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) only. |

---

## Review

| Item | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Update PRs | One approval from a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) is sufficient. |

---

## Repository layout

Single TypeScript package (Node.js 24, pnpm). Source in `src/`, tests in `test/unit` (no Docker) and `test/integration` (Docker), the Terraform module in `terraform/`, documentation in `docs/`.

Coding standards for AI agents live in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md); reusable agent workflows are skills under [`.agents/skills/`](./.agents/skills/).

---

## Automation

### Build pipeline

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every pull request and every push to `main`: lint, type check, unit tests and build, then the integration tests against Azurite and mocks of Azure Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI.

### Release pipeline

[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) runs on every pushed version tag and publishes the multi-architecture image to GitHub Container Registry, with SBOM and build provenance.
